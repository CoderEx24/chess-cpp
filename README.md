# Chess (ABANDONED)

*THIS CODEBASE HAS BEEN ABANDONED, I'M REDOING IT ALL AGAIN, IN RUST :3*

this is a simple chess game written in C++
the code should consists of 2 parts, core and ui

core should contain all the game logic, ui should contain all rendering logic
the ui will be entirely implemented using SFML
